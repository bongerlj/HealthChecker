Steps for successful compilation and runtime of code:
	1. Navigate to Constants.java and select the appropriate CSV file to parse (ex.csv is the smaller file for fast testing)
	2. Navigate to mainGui.java and click run
	3. If the smaller file is being used, wait up to 10 seconds for UI to show up (how fast the UI opens depends on the computer spec)
	4. Enjoy!!
